# HTML Structure Webpage Project

## Project Overview
This project is the first step in a series of web development projects aimed at building a fully functional webpage from a designer file. In this specific project, the focus is on creating a clean and semantic **HTML structure** without applying any CSS or styling elements. 

The design of the webpage is provided in **Figma**, and the goal is to translate the layout and content accurately into pure HTML.

## Objectives
- Recreate the structure of the webpage using only HTML elements.
- Ensure proper use of HTML5 semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
- Align the layout based on the provided Figma file without styling.
- Organize the content meaningfully for accessibility and clarity.
- Prepare for future projects where CSS styling will be applied on top of this structure.

## Figma Design
The design for this project can be found in the following Figma link:

- [Figma Project](#)  
*(Duplicate the project to your Drafts to view the design details).*

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the proper fonts are used. If your computer is missing fonts, you can download them:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - Spin Cycle OT (check your font provider)
- Certain measurements in the design are in float values (e.g., 2.6px). Feel free to round these values to the nearest whole number when necessary.

## Installation and Usage

    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the HTML structure.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Focus on semantic markup to ensure the page is structured properly for both users and search engines.

## Future Enhancements
- In future projects, CSS will be added to this structure to style the webpage according to the Figma design.
- Accessibility improvements and JavaScript functionality will also be incorporated in later stages.

## Final Thoughts
This project represents the foundational work in a broader web development series. By focusing solely on HTML structure in this phase, we lay the groundwork for well-structured, maintainable code that can be easily styled and enhanced in future projects. Stay tuned for the next steps, where CSS styling and JavaScript interactivity will be added.
